# Konza3D
A 3D Game where you are challenged to fix and preserve the natural glimpses of Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. In the sorry sight of a defaced game park, take the right steps to bring back the beauty of the mountains, streams, and trees. The puzzle is so much fun! This is a game developed for Global Game Jam 2020 in Chipata, Zambia
